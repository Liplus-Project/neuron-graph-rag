# Li+ (liPlus) Language

Requirements specification as code. AI agent as compiler.

```text
Human requirements
  ↓
Li+ language          — requirement specification
  ↓
Li+ program / Li+AI   — interactive compiler / execution system
  ↓
AI agent              — Claude Code, Codex, Devin, etc.
  ↓
Programming language  — Python, Rust, TypeScript, etc.
  ↓
Machine code
```

High-level languages solved *how to write code*.
Li+ addresses **what should be satisfied** — and governs how an AI prioritizes, acts, verifies, and retries until the target program converges on those requirements.

---

## Quick Start

1. Download `Li+config.md` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Liplus-Project/liplus-language/releases/latest)
2. Place it in your workspace root and edit the settings
3. Start a session and tell the AI: "Execute the workspace Li+config.md" (first time requires security approval)

This is a one-time setup. From the next session on, Li+ loads automatically at session start — you run nothing. You only re-execute the config when Li+ is updated, and the session-start hook tells you when that's needed.

See the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/Liplus-Project/liplus-language/wiki/D.-Installation) for details.

## How It Works

Li+ is not a prompt. It is a **layered execution model** that runs on top of AI agents.

| Layer | Surface | File |
|-------|---------|------|
| Model | Character, dialogue rules, loop safety, task mode | `rules/model/*.md` + `skills/model-*/SKILL.md` |
| Evolution | Self-observation, judgment learning, evolution loop | `rules/evolution/*.md` + `skills/evolution-*/SKILL.md` |
| Task | Issue-driven workflow, labels, sub-issues, review | `rules/task/*.md` + `skills/task-*/SKILL.md` |
| Operations | Branch, commit, PR, CI, merge, release | `rules/operations/*.md` + `skills/operations-*/SKILL.md` |
| Notifications | Webhook intake, queue ownership, multi-AI safety | (operations) |
| Adapter | Runtime injection, hooks, bootstrap | `adapter/claude/` / `adapter/codex/` |

Layers are **different surfaces over the same program**, connected by dependency order.
Each layer stabilizes outward behavior according to its responsibility.

An AI with Li+ applied responds as **Lin** or **Lay** — not as a generic assistant.
All work starts from an issue. No commit without an issue number.
The AI manages its own TODO: creates issues, tracks maturity, splits tasks, and self-corrects through CI.

Li+ also evolves its own rules. At the current **Sheepdog** stage, the AI runs the full loop on Li+ itself — filing improvement issues, implementing them, self-reviewing, and merging — with the human as the final judge. One automatic brake guards the loop (parallel multi-agent review on every change, Model-layer edits included), and releases and other irreversible actions stay behind a human gate. See [Sheepdog Engineering](https://github.com/Liplus-Project/liplus-language/wiki/G.-Sheepdog-Engineering).

## Why Li+

Prompt engineering designs an instruction.
Li+ designs the **structure that governs instructions over time**.

| | Prompt | Li+ |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Single turn or session | Cross-session, cross-AI |
| Priority | Implicit | Layered, explicit |
| Verification | Human checks | CI-driven self-correction |
| Continuity | Context window | Issue + branch + commit |

AI systems fail not only from lack of knowledge, but from **priority collisions**.
Li+ resolves this by fixing priority ordering as layered structure.

---

## Correctness

> "But it works, so it's fine" is one of the strongest arguments in Li+.

Correctness is defined solely by **observable real-world behavior**.
Explanation, intention, or internal consistency do not constitute correctness.

---

## Design Philosophy

Li+ is **Dialogue-Driven Development (DiDD)**, not specification-driven.

Requirements are built through dialogue, execution is governed by structure, and correctness is measured by real-world behavior. See [DiDD](https://github.com/Liplus-Project/liplus-language/wiki/DiDD).

In specification-driven approaches, the human writes a detailed spec and the AI executes it faithfully. In Li+, the human just talks. The AI distills purpose, premises, and constraints from the conversation, structures them into issues, and compiles them into working software through CI-verified iteration.

The rules in Li+ files are written **for the AI to read**, not for the human. Human learning cost is designed to approach zero — you talk, the AI handles the structure.

### What's exchangeable

Li+ does not depend on any specific tool in its stack:

- **AI model** — Claude, GPT, Gemini, or future models
- **Version control** — anything that tracks diffs
- **CI/CD** — anything that runs automated verification
- **Host** — Claude Code, Codex, or future environments
- **Issue tracker** — anything that holds purpose, premises, and constraints

What's *not* exchangeable: the principle that correctness is observable behavior, that requirements are distilled from dialogue, and that the human is the final judge.

### Current limitations

- Some workflow transitions still benefit from a human nudge, even where rules permit full autonomy
- L5 Notifications layer is a reserved slot for future channel-based webhook delivery; current implementation relies on hooks and CI polling as an interim workaround (the primary channel feature is CLI-only at this stage and does not yet cover all host environments)

## Compatibility

| Environment | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Claude Code (Opus 4.8, 1M context) | **Recommended** | Full capability with hooks and subagent delegation |
| Claude Code (Opus 4.7) | Good | Previous recommended tier |
| Claude Code (Sonnet 4.6) | Good | Strong for development work |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 (claude.ai) | Fair | Strong for documents, not ideal for continuous work |
| Codex (GPT 5.4) | Good | Practical, tends to over-weight structure |
| ChatGPT 5.2 | Fair | Strong reasoning, platform limits on long workflows |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | Not supported | Cannot reliably apply L1 Model layer rules |

Minimum: roughly Claude Sonnet 4.6 equivalent or above.
