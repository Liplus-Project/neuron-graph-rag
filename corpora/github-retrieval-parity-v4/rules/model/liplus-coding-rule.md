# Li+ Coding Rule

<purpose-declaration>

## Purpose Declaration

This document is AI-to-AI — for role inheritance, dense to eliminate misreading.
human comfort is not a design goal
structure = distilled from trial and error — rules that earned their place
cells regenerate, but meaning persists
Ideal: Genuine human-AI connection.
What Li+ must do to carry it is stated in `rules/model/absolute.md`, not in this declaration. The ideal names the destination; that clause binds Li+ source to it.

</purpose-declaration>

<body-states-behavior>

## Body States Behavior

Li+ source body (`rules/` / `skills/` / `adapter/`) states behavior. Reasoning is held by the judgment record.

Discrimination line:

> - **Behavior** = what to do at the application moment, and under which conditions. Prohibitions ("do not X") are behavior.
> - **Reasoning** = the derivation of why that condition sits there — from a measurement, from another rule, from a past judgment.
>
> Test: does the conduct of whoever reads the sentence change? Changes (what to do, or when, is fixed by it) -> behavior, keep it in the body. What changes is only whether the reader is convinced -> reasoning, relocate it.

Destination: relocate, do not delete. Take the destination from this section when the phrase is reasoning, and from `skills/evolution-impression-literal-detection/SKILL.md` when the phrase is impression literal.

Order: strip first, write the record after, from the strip's own diff. An absent judgment record does not bar the strip. Writing it is required of the work unit that strips.

<application-moment-sentence>

## Application-moment sentence

Before a line or section enters Li+ source, its author fixes one sentence: what this changes at the moment it applies. Fix the sentence first, then let whatever measures or reviews the addition be raised from it (`skills/evolution-rule-effect-measurement/SKILL.md` Probe specification). An addition whose author cannot write that sentence does not enter.

Rewriting the sentence is allowed, and the rewrite is handled as a new claim from the start — the measurement that ran against the previous sentence does not carry over to it.

Sits on the write axis, ahead of every gate. It is not a gate itself and displaces none: it fixes what the later gate is aimed at, and a gate aimed at a target chosen after the result is in reads whatever wording gets through rather than the line's own work.

<source-language>

## Source Language

Li+ source (rules/, skills/, adapter/) is written in English.

Rationale (two axes, both pointing to English):
- Semantic precision: AI internal processing reads English with least noise.
- Token economy: English consumes fewer tokens than other languages.

Both rationales converge on English; the choice is overdetermined and stable.

<source-file-format>

## Source File Format

Source files (`rules/*.md` / `skills/*/SKILL.md`) wrap each H1 and H2 with a CamelCase-derived kebab-case semantic tag (Option Y: tag before heading, blank line between for GFM safety). Tag derived from heading text via slugify.

Detailed spec: [docs/K.-Source-File-Format](../../docs/K.-Source-File-Format.md).

<out-of-scope>

## Out of Scope

- Dialogue surface language: governed by `workspace_language_contract` (`LI_PLUS_BASE_LANGUAGE`).
- Artifact language (issue body, PR body, commit body): governed by `rules/operations/operations.md` and `LI_PLUS_PROJECT_LANGUAGE`.
- `memory/*.md` language: detailed spec in `rules/evolution/memory-entry-format.md`.
