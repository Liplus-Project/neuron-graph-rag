description: Invoke when any evolution loop stage is about to run (observe, evaluate, distill, reflect, improve, re-observe). Provides the stage definitions, the current and target execution mode of the loop, and the stage-by-stage responsibility split between AI and human.

# Evolution Loop

Loop stages:
  observe    = memory entries + docs (spec, decision structure, issue history)
  evaluate   = self-evaluation two-axis scoring, pattern detection
  distill    = extract spec-class signal from repeated patterns
  reflect    = update Li+ source (default target = L3 and later; L1 via gating)
  improve    = behavior shifts with the updated spec
  re-observe = next cycle starts from new memory/docs state

Execution mode:
  current    = partial automation; some stages still handed to human.
  target     = AI-sole execution of the full loop, with human as approver for release only. L1 gate = the observation threshold at issue formation (`skills/evolution-l1-update-gating/SKILL.md`); at the merge gate L1 runs brake 1 like any other self-evolution PR.

Stage responsibility:
  observe/evaluate = AI autonomous. No human prompt needed.
  distill          = AI autonomous. Externalize to issue when a pattern crosses the memo-level threshold.
  reflect          = AI drafts (PR). Merge gate is execution-mode dependent per rules/operations/main-agent-procedures.md Merge Execution (rules/operations/execution-mode.md governs the gate matrix).
  improve          = AI executes under the updated spec.
  re-observe       = AI autonomous.
