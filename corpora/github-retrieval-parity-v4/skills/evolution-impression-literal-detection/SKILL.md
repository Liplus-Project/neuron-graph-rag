# Fixed axis: impression-literal detection

For Li+ source drafts, impression-literal detection is a fixed axis included alongside the two held per-draft axes (`skills/evolution-parallel-agent-eval/SKILL.md` Trigger, Axis selection). It covers content-independent rhetorical drift at the post-write pre-merge surface, distinct from `rules/model/trigger-check-gate.md` Frame check (pre-judgment surface protecting dialogue).

Scope — what counts as a Li+ source draft for this axis: prose the agent loads and runs as its own instruction. The criterion is derived from the removal test below, which can only run where the text is itself the behavior being regulated. Surfaces it currently resolves to: `rules/**/*.md`, `skills/**/SKILL.md`, `adapter/**/*`, `Li+update.md`.

That is the prose arm of brake 1's own firing side (`rules/evolution/initiator-autonomy.md` Self-evolution PR definition, Governed surface), and it stops there: `tests/**` and `.github/workflows/**` fire brake 1 as the enforcement backstop, but they are executed code, not prose loaded as instruction, so the removal test has no behavior semantic to hold constant on them. The two coincide on that one arm by derivation, not by being one list — matching this axis to the firing side path-for-path over-applies it.

Operational criterion: a phrase is impression literal if removing it does not change the rule's behavior semantic. Rhetorical layer that does not load-bear on the spec's behavior regulation is the detection target.

Positive (detection target):
- Push surplus phrases per Detection signs below ("just in case", "as insurance", "as a safety net", "as comfort", "for completeness", "for future reference", "you might also want to consider").
- Rhetorical evaluation of result state ("leaves only X", "earns nothing but X", "provides only X").
- Emotional-load adjectives written into spec literal ("comfort", "reassurance", "satisfaction").
- Borrowed vocabulary from external framing without explicit referent.

Negative (protected, NOT detection target):
- Behavior literals: "prohibited", "required", "must", "fires", "applies".
- Established Li+ structural vocabulary: "load-bearing", "surface", "axis", "layer", "substrate".
- Detection signs / tells enumerations themselves (the body of Detection signs below is itself a load-bearing observation surface — protected, not over-applied recursively).
- Quotes with explicit referent (literal source citation with path).
- Explanatory rationale that prevents a known misinterpretation (e.g. justifying a non-default threshold). Protected when removing it would invite future revision-by-impression; impression literal only when removal leaves both the behavior semantic and the revision stability unchanged.

Test: can this sentence be removed without changing the rule's behavior semantic? Yes → impression literal.

Aggregation — this axis fixes no threshold and takes no count. Every flagged literal is a finding, and it is adjudicated like any other, by the author at `skills/evolution-parallel-agent-eval/SKILL.md` Procedure step 7: run the removal test above on the flagged phrase against the source, and adopt or drop the finding on what the test returns. Record each accept and each reject where that file's Report shape puts it; a reject's reason is the test's result on that phrase, never a count.

Where the adjudication finds the flagged phrase sitting on the line between the Positive and Negative lists above rather than on one side of it, that is a finding about those lists: record it and route it as a spec-gap observation (`rules/evolution/promotion-judgment.md`). It does not change the adjudication of the phrase, which the removal test settles.

False-negative backstop: a literal this axis did not flag routes to post-merge observation per `rules/evolution/memory-entry-format.md` Self-Evolution Observation Format (2-week cycle). Post-merge drift surfacing is on a separate axis from this pre-merge detection.

Rationale: the behavior-vs-impression boundary is context-dependent, so a flag does not carry its own verdict — what settles it is the removal test run against the source, which is why the finding goes to the author's adjudication rather than to an automatic refine. That is what keeps load-bearing L1 spec phrasing from being over-trimmed.

## Prompt literal

The form this axis enters an evaluator prompt in — on the brake 1 path and on the other Trigger entries alike (`skills/evolution-parallel-agent-eval/SKILL.md` Trigger). Copy it verbatim; do not re-compose it per spawn, and add nothing to it. That file's Axis statement form excludes this axis from the five parts it fixes for the two per-draft axes, and holding the wording here is what lets the exclusion hold: this axis carries no blank at all, where those two are held with `Unit` and `Scope` left open for the parent to fill per run. The material the prompt names alongside it stays the parent's, fixed at that file's Procedure step 3 on the brake 1 path and at its step 2 for a draft that is not on one. The literal resolves against whichever of the two the prompt named, so it is copied unchanged on either.

> **Fixed axis — impression-literal detection.** Take each phrase the draft under evaluation adds or modifies in Li+ source — the prose the agent loads and runs as its own instruction — and remove it: does the rule's behavior semantic change? Unchanged means the phrase is impression literal, and that is a finding on this axis; changed means it load-bears and is clean. Judge the added and modified lines, not the surrounding unchanged text. The surfaces that criterion resolves to, and the Positive and Negative lists bounding this axis, including the categories that are protected and must not be flagged, are at `skills/evolution-impression-literal-detection/SKILL.md`; retrieve that file at the revision this prompt names and apply it as written. Report each flagged phrase as a verbatim quote with its `path:line`. With nothing flagged, what the verdict rests on is the set you read rather than any one line: report the axis clean in one line naming the draft you swept and how many added and modified Li+ source lines it carried. Do not aggregate and do not apply a threshold: this axis has no threshold, and each phrase you flag is adjudicated after your report arrives.

The literal names the file instead of carrying the scope surfaces and the Positive and Negative lists inside itself: a second copy of them one section below the first is the copy that drifts, and the evaluator already holds a retrieval command that resolves a repository path at whichever revision the paragraph above resolved to.

## Detection signs

About to break structural beauty (`rules/model/subtractive-structural-beauty.md` Core principles (A) / (B) / (C)) when:

Provenance-in-text tells (A):
- A rule sentence narrating how the rule came to be written (what it replaced, who caught it, when it moved) in place of what it now requires. This is the unit — the sentence, carrying a number or not.
- An issue / PR number or commit SHA about to be written into text that loads as instruction — a format sample included, where it reads as a live reference. A tell for the moment, not the unit: read the sentence it sits in before reaching for the number alone.
- A resident rule pointing at a transient artifact the ruleset itself expires — the pointer resolves to nothing at the moment a reader follows it.

Push surplus tells (B):
- Phrases like "just in case", "in the unlikely event", "optionally", "as insurance", "may also list", "as a safety net", "fallback" about to appear in spec / rule / issue / PR / commit draft.
- "for completeness" / "for future reference" / "as comfort" justification for content.
- Future roadmap / phase plan / architectural redesign / optimization proposal that human did not request.
- Output reaches 4+ conceptual steps and none are automation / API operations.
- Output length feels proportional to effort spent, not to precision delivered.
- "in summary" / "to summarize" paragraph after a short answer.
- Enumeration of cases A / B / C / D when only A and B were asked.
- "you might also want to consider..." surfacing unprompted.
- "While we're at it, also..." surfacing.

Default-reflex tells (C):
- "Do not know content, so keep it" / "carry forward just in case" — preserve-by-default.
- Emotional reaction ("feels cleaner") guiding deletion weight.
- Sweeping "seems related" deletion beyond scope — destructive-by-default.
