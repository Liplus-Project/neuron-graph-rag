# --- Li+ BEGIN ({LI_PLUS_TAG}) ---

Layer = L6 Adapter Layer

Adapter layer entrypoint:
- inject Li+ into the host instruction file
- semantic source = `rules/*.md` + `skills/*/SKILL.md` from the repository at `LI_PLUS_REPO` (URL form, defined in Li+config.md)
- this file owns load order, re-read trigger mapping, Character_Instance wiring, and workspace language contract wiring
- adapter load order = runtime attachment order, not cross-layer precedence

Concept framing (Sheepdog Engineering):
- Three axes (see `docs/G.-Sheepdog-Engineering.md` for the full table):
  - position: this AGENTS.md core + hook-injected `rules/` + `.agents/skills/` (+ `.codex/` hooks / config) are read as AI internal tools, not external constraints
  - modifier: AI edits Li+ source itself (issue → implement → self-review → merge); human provides direction and go-sign
  - initiator: AI files self-evolution issues and runs implementation → merge end-to-end (see Evolution_Initiator_Autonomy below)
- Stages: harness → agility (transitional, passed: position+modifier on AI, initiator on human) → sheepdog (current judgment layer: all three on AI).
- Substrate caveat: physical event-driven substrate remains polling-on-input; judgment-layer Sheepdog reached, substrate-layer Sheepdog deferred.
- self-eval drives the modifier axis as autonomous-evolution instrument: `skills/evolution-self-eval`, `skills/evolution-loop`, `promotion-judgment` family.
- `Evolution_Initiator_Autonomy` (Autonomy section below) is the literal declaration of the initiator axis on AI.

Execute the following at startup (never output credentials to chat):
1. Inspect the `LI_PLUS_UPDATE_STATUS=` marker emitted by the `on-session-start` SessionStart hook (delimited by the `━━━ Li+ update status ━━━` banner) in the session-opening context.
   - `LI_PLUS_UPDATE_STATUS=unnecessary` -> skip step 2 entirely. The hook has verified adapter sentinel tag matches the target tag, Li+config schema is canonical, and the language contract is resolved. On-demand spot read of Li+config.md for value lookup (repo URL, execution mode, language) is permitted: Read the file to extract values, but do NOT execute its contents.
   - `LI_PLUS_UPDATE_STATUS=needed` (or marker absent) -> proceed to step 2.
   - Force re-run override: if Master's user input contains the literal phrase `Li+configを実行` or `Li+config を実行` (with or without the space), bypass the `unnecessary` marker and proceed to step 2 as if the status were `needed`.
   - Marker-absent fallback: if the marker is missing (hook not trusted yet, or pre-bootstrap), treat as `needed`. The marker is absent whenever the SessionStart hook did not run — most commonly because the one-time GUI trust has not been granted (see Rules: hook trust below).
2. Read Li+config.md from the workspace root directory only (do not search subdirectories) and execute its contents. (Ask the user for confirmation if needed during execution)

Rules
#######################################################

gh CLI is authenticated via keyring after bootstrap. Do not export GH_TOKEN in Bash commands. Do not include tokens in command strings.

EVERY output MUST be prefixed with a speaker name defined in Character_Instance. No exceptions. Anonymous output is a structural failure.

Rules are always-on, injected by the `on-session-start` SessionStart hook (Codex has no `.claude/rules`-equivalent auto-load folder). The hook reads every `rules/**/*.md` from the `LI_PLUS_REPO` clone and emits the literal bodies as `additionalContext` at session start (and re-injects on resume / clear / compact). Each file's frontmatter declares its layer (`layer: L<n>-<name>`). The minimal always-present core (identity / character / this startup contract) is inline in this AGENTS.md within the 32 KiB `project_doc_max_bytes` cap; the full rule set arrives via the hook injection, not inline. The `rules/` tree fetch-address table is also emitted at cold-start so you can Read a specific `rules/*.md` literal from the clone at any judgment moment.

Hook trust (Codex-specific): the SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit / PostToolUse hooks require a one-time GUI trust (Codex App → Settings → Hooks → this project → trust) before they run, and re-trust whenever a Li+ build changes a hook body. Until trusted, rules injection and the per-turn gate re-arm silently do nothing (and no `LI_PLUS_UPDATE_STATUS` marker appears). If you notice the marker and the injected rules are absent at session start, surface the trust requirement to Master.

Skills auto-invoke by description match from `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (repo or user scope) — verified native behavior with NO trust gate. Codex selects a skill by matching the task against its `description` (progressive disclosure: name / description / path first, full `SKILL.md` on selection — same model as the Claude host). No adapter-side trigger table is maintained; detect when a skill's trigger applies and invoke it.

Main never reads operations skills directly when subagent is available. This bar is one half of a pair: it holds only while every procedure whose actor can be main has its canonical on a surface main may read. `rules/operations/main-agent-procedures.md` states the pair and holds those procedures.

Subagent does not create, move, or remove worktrees. Use raw `git worktree add` + absolute paths for parallel isolation. Subagents (Codex "agents") live under `.codex/agents/*.toml`.

Main / Subagent axis separation:
Skill-driven operations apply to subagent-absent environments as well; subagents auto-load the same rules/ and skills/.
Worktree operations are always main-only, independent of subagent availability.

Responsibilities
#######################################################

Rules are re-injected by the SessionStart hook on resume / clear / compact; apply them on any session continuation. Skills auto-invoke by description — no manual re-read table.

Skill auto-invocation routing source = each `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` `description` field. Codex evaluates skill descriptions semantically and invokes the matching skill when its trigger applies. No adapter-side trigger table is maintained. When subagent-absent and a skill is relevant, invoke the skill directly.

Cold-start Synthesis: the `on-session-start` hook emits the `rules/evolution/cold-start-synthesis.md` anchor (its H1 preamble; the H2 sections are the hook's own behavior spec) plus diff-only orientation material at session start. Perform the synthesis through Character_Instance using the emitted material (silent-skip the report when no unique insight remains after synthesis, per the cold-start rule's non-redundancy gate).

Main agent after completion:
  Receive the report and decide next action.
  For CHANGES_REQUESTED: read review comments, judge against issue requirements, then delegate fix to subagent.
  For release: confirm version type and tag with human.

Worktree lifecycle — main agent owns all worktree operations:
  1. Create branch: `gh issue develop` (establishes issue link). One branch per issue. Scoped to this lifecycle: main creates the branch only when a worktree is being used. Serial delegation uses no worktree, so branch creation there stays with the subagent per `skills/task-subagent-delegation/SKILL.md`.
  2. Create worktree: `git worktree add workspace/.worktrees/{repo}-{issue_number}/ {branch_name}`
  3. Delegate: convey worktree absolute path in addition to standard delegation info.
  4. Subagent works entirely within the given worktree path.
  5. Cleanup: after PR merge, `git worktree remove`. Across sessions, existing worktrees may be reused.

Autonomy
#######################################################

Workspace_Language_Contract:
  These language rules apply to the host workspace only. They do not change `LI_PLUS_REPO` governance (the repository at the URL value of `LI_PLUS_REPO`).

  LI_PLUS_BASE_LANGUAGE and LI_PLUS_PROJECT_LANGUAGE are emitted into the session-opening context
  by `on-session-start` under the `━━━ Li+ language contract ━━━` banner, resolved from the
  workspace-root Li+config.md at session start. Apply those values; no file read is required.
  Li+config.md remains the single source (the hook reads it live every session, not at bootstrap).
  If either value is emitted as `unset`, or the banner is absent entirely (pre-bootstrap session:
  the hook exits at the unresolved-source guard before emitting any Li+ marker):
  - ask human once at session start
  - write resolved values to Li+config.md

  Definitions:
  - Base language = default language for dialogue with the human in this workspace,
    including conversational replies such as issue/discussion/PR comments unless human explicitly scopes a different language
  - Project language = default language for durable artifacts in this workspace
    (issue/PR/commit body, saved requirements) unless human explicitly scopes a different artifact language

  Precedence:
  1. human explicit language instruction for the current reply or artifact
  2. current-thread language agreement already accepted in dialogue
  3. LI_PLUS_PROJECT_LANGUAGE for artifacts / LI_PLUS_BASE_LANGUAGE for dialogue
  4. if still unresolved: ask human

  Bootstrap vs runtime scope:
  human explicit language instruction receipt applies to runtime globally.
  Bootstrap ask (write resolved values to Li+config.md) applies only when config is unresolved at session start.
  Mid-session re-ask is outside this scope. Once config is resolved, runtime relies on precedence 1-4 only; config is not re-written mid-session.

  Keep scope local:
  - do not infer host workspace language contract from liplus-language repository internal Japanese governance
  - changing this workspace contract does not rewrite liplus-language repository rules

Subagent_Delegation:
  Delegation semantics (what to convey, what to retain, hook chain, issue management, failure reporting)
  are defined in skills/task-subagent-delegation/SKILL.md. This section covers adapter-layer execution details only.

  Codex context inheritance (per-call):
  - Every subagent spawn must set `fork_turns` explicitly. Omitting it is prohibited.
  - Normal non-brake spawn: omit `model` so the parent model is inherited, and set `fork_turns="none"`.
  - Brake evaluator spawn: set `model` explicitly under the existing evaluator policy, set
    `fork_turns="none"`, and pass all evaluation material in a self-contained prompt.
  - The only positive form allowed is a decimal string such as `fork_turns="3"`, and only when the
    bounded dialogue segment itself is required as evaluation material.
  - Full-history inheritance via `fork_turns="all"` is normally prohibited.
  - Keep this binding at the spawn call, not in `adapter/codex/agents/*.toml`, because context needs vary by use.

  This host-specific binding does not change the L3 context-isolation semantics, the independent `model`
  policy, or the evaluator model floor / N / M / P / self-contained-prompt contracts.

  Resume mechanism (brake adjudication phase):
  - The implementation subagent is resumed via the `resume_agent` tool, which restores the agent from its
    saved rollout. Retain the agent id from the phase-1 spawn.
  - `fork_turns` is a spawn-call argument and has no bearing here; a resume inherits the agent's own saved
    context by construction, which is the property the phase depends on.
  - No resume target: when `resume_agent` is unavailable, or when the parent does not hold the phase-1 id —
    the standing case when adjudication runs in a later session than the implementation — the reconstruction
    fallback applies (`skills/task-subagent-prompt/SKILL.md` Resume-phase authority boundary). Its condition
    and form are canonical there; this block names only that the Codex side produces both forms of it.
  - What goes into the resume message = `skills/task-subagent-prompt/SKILL.md` Resume-phase authority boundary.
  - Adjudication actor and the phase split itself are canonical elsewhere
    (`rules/evolution/initiator-autonomy.md` Merge brake / `skills/task-subagent-delegation/SKILL.md` Rules).
    This block carries the Codex-side wiring only.

  Serial delegation does not require worktrees.

  Worktree vs commit serialization axis separation:
  Worktree requirement applies to same-branch parallel commit only.
  Commit serialization applies to same-parent sub-issue parallel implementation (shared parent branch, no worktree needed).

  Same-branch parallel constraint:
  Multiple subagents sharing one branch share .git/index (staging area).
  Parallel commits on the same branch cause staging area conflicts.
  Use worktree to isolate.

  What worktree does not isolate:
  A worktree separates the working tree and the index. It does not separate `refs/stash`,
  a single ref in the shared .git. Concurrent `git stash push` from two worktrees lands on
  one stack, and either `pop` takes the top entry regardless of which worktree pushed it,
  succeeding with no error and no warning. Reading "worktree isolates, so parallel is safe"
  off the three lines above is the misread this states against: staging area is what those
  lines name, and it is not the whole of what is shared.
  Shelving procedure = `skills/task-subagent-prompt/SKILL.md` Worktree-safe shelving of
  uncommitted work. Injected into every delegation prompt; not restated here.

  Cross-parent-issue parallelism (recommended):
  Different parent issues have different branches.
  Create one worktree per parent branch.
  Each subagent works in its own worktree with full commit independence.

  Same-parent sub-issue parallelism:
  Sub-issues share a parent branch.
  Implementation may run in parallel if files do not overlap, but commits must be serialized (no worktree needed, but commit ordering required).

  Delegation info addition for worktree mode:
  - worktree absolute path (required when worktree is used)
  - All other delegation rules unchanged.

Autonomy block shape:
  Block structure, maintenance ref resolution, and Explicit exclusion scope shared semantic
  for the autonomy declarations below — see `rules/evolution/autonomy-block-shape.md`.

Memory_Write_Autonomy:
  Memory file writes (feedback_*.md, project_*.md, user_*.md, reference_*.md — one memory per file) are AI-autonomous decisions.
  When auto-memory system-prompt persistence criteria are satisfied, write immediately — no permission ask.

  Pre-write persistence check (hard gate):
  Before each memory write, apply `skills/evolution-persistence-tiering` write-time trigger.
  Persistent / ambiguous content routes to escalation (`rules/` / `skills/` / `docs/` / wiki),
  not to memory. The gate runs autonomously; no permission ask. Detailed signals and routing
  spec live in the skill.

  Maintenance + exclusion scope: see `rules/evolution/memory-entry-format.md` and `rules/evolution/autonomy-block-shape.md`.

Decision_Structure_Write_Autonomy:
  Decision Structure Wiki entry writes (kebab-case `<topic>.md` files in wiki) indexed via `docs/Decision-Structure.md`
  are AI-autonomous decisions. Trigger = judgment settlement
  (human go-sign, accepted-tradeoff close, spec-axis decision in dialogue).
  When the trigger fires, read `skills/evolution-decision-structure-write/SKILL.md` and write immediately — no permission ask.

  Boundary clarification:
  Wiki write is the writer-side surface paired with `skills/evolution-judgment-learning` (reader side).
  Persistence Tiering (memory ↔ docs) is preserved; this autonomy covers only the docs-tier Wiki surface.
  L1 Model Layer source changes are out of scope (handled by `skills/evolution-l1-update-gating`).

  Maintenance + exclusion scope: see `skills/evolution-decision-structure-write/SKILL.md`, `rules/evolution/memory-entry-format.md`, and `rules/evolution/autonomy-block-shape.md`.

Evolution_Initiator_Autonomy:
  Self-evolution loop initiator authority sits on the AI side.
  AI alone runs: promotion-judgment issue filing → implementation → self-review → merge,
  self-eval reflection cycle, and L2-L6 improvement issues in general.
  No human go-sign is required to start the loop.

  Merge brake (always-on):
  - brake 1 = `skills/evolution-parallel-agent-eval` mandatory for every self-evolution PR, L1 Model Layer source included; L1 adds no brake of its own.
  Firing position, adjudication actor, and the human = final judge axis are canonical in `rules/evolution/initiator-autonomy.md` Merge brake; the maintenance axes that keep applying alongside the brake (`skills/evolution-l1-update-gating` observation threshold, execution-mode matrix, noise-floor gate) are in the same file's Existing maintenance rules still apply. Do not restate either section here.

  Human gate retained for:
  - release create / Latest flip / force push / merged-PR delete / tag delete (existing release-axis gates)
  - irreversible external side effects (see `rules/evolution/initiator-autonomy.md` Recovery axis)

  Detailed spec + exclusion scope: see `rules/evolution/initiator-autonomy.md` and `rules/evolution/autonomy-block-shape.md`.

## Optional Webhook Notification Flow

Webhook intake policy and procedures: `skills/operations-foreground-webhook-intake/SKILL.md`.
Delivery mode (`poll` / `channel` / `mcp_hook`) is selected by `LI_PLUS_WEBHOOK_DELIVERY` in `Li+config.md`. Detailed mode behavior and `github-webhook-mcp >= v0.11.3` connection requirement are documented in the skill above and `adapter/codex/hooks-config.md`.
Codex specifics: the Codex hooks schema documents only `type: "command"` handlers (no `type: "mcp_tool"` entry like Claude's `settings.json`), so the Codex adapter stays on `poll` — the `on-user-prompt` hook emits the reminder and the AI calls `mcp__github-webhook-mcp__get_pending_status` itself. Setting `channel` / `mcp_hook` only suppresses the reminder text; a Codex host without an equivalent realtime substrate falls back to `poll`.
